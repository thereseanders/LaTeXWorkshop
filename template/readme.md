This folder contains the LaTeX template we will use during the second part of the workshop. We will use the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) online compiler during the lab session. Participants are asked to please do the following prior to the start of the workshop:

1. Ceate an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account.
2. Download the *template* folder from Github.
